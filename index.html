        <h2>HOW AN AI CHATBOT WORKS</h2>
        <p>Today, one of the biggest roadblocks to AI adoption is that nearly half of all marketers consider themselves
          AI beginners. But the truth is you don‚Äôt need to have a PhD in NLP (or even be a programmer) to set up an AI
          chatbot.

          All you need is a good AI chatbot software and a basic understanding of how an AI chatbot operates. Here‚Äôs a
          quick rundown üëá<br><br>

          <h2>AI chatbots by Drift</h2>

          At the base level, an AI chatbot is fed input data which it interprets and translates into a relevant output.
          So, if a site visitor asks a question, the AI chatbot will analyze their intent, as well as other factors like
          tone and sentiment, and then attempt to deliver the best possible answer. <br><br>

          To do this, the AI chatbot needs access to tons of conversational data. That‚Äôs why AI chatbots have to go
          through a training period where a programmer teaches it how to understand the context of a person‚Äôs words.
          It‚Äôs this understanding which allows the chatbot to answer complex queries in a natural, conversational way. <br>

          If the idea of training an AI chatbot is sounding off alarm bells for you, don‚Äôt worry. Drift‚Äôs Conversational
          AI, for example, is pre-trained on over six-billion conversations, as well as topics specific to your company,
          making it available out-of-the-box. Through the AI Topic Library, you can customize responses to common
          topics, adding and generating examples for those topics, and even creating new custom topics. Plus, with
          Drift‚Äôs GPT integration, you can automatically generate topic examples so that you can save time while
          training your chatbot, which means going live with AI even faster.

          Now that you know the basics of how an AI chatbot works, with the right software in place, you can create a
          conversational experience that delivers the right information to your site visitors at the right time. To
